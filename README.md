# simd.scot
Interactive map of SIMD (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation)

The JS, HTML, CSS, non-map images and some GeoJSON and CSV files from the project. 

This is a working version of SIMD.scot except:
* No tiled attribute data (UTF Grid tiles) as this uses PHP to retrieve JSON files from server.
* Raster image tiles are not included. CORS may stop these being retrieved from my server.

The datasets used are generally Open Government Licence (Crown Copyright).
